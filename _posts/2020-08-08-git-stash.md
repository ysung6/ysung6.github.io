`git stash` is often used when working with multiple branches. But when using this frequently, you might end up with multiple stashes. And when you do have multiple stashes showing up as a result of your `git stash list` command, it becomes confusing which stash you should apply.

## Stash with message

Like commit messages, you can add messages to your stash and have them show up when using `git stash list`.

The command is `git stash push -m "stash message"`.

So if I were working on adding flake8 to my project and had to checkout a branch for a hotfix, I'd do something like `git stash push -m "try using flake8"` and then come back to it later.

By using a relevant message, you won't have to rely on your memory or thoroughly go through the changes to remind yourself what the stash was about.



## Further tips

I use [scm_breeze](https://github.com/scmbreeze) when working on the command line. It comes with aliases that can be convenient when using git.
For example `ga` is an alias for `git add` and `gashp` is an alias for `git stash pop`.
It did not offer an alias for `git stash push -m` though. So I've added an alias `gashm` for that.

I recommend giving [scm_breeze](https://github.com/scmbreeze) a try.
It can really help you get more productive on the command line.

Cheers.
